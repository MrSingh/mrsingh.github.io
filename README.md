# Notes

These are my private notes on data and software engineering. This site is built using Hugo and deployed to GitHub pages at https://puneet.uk.

## Hugo

-------

### Trouble Shooting Hugo

+ If you have trouble building and delete the public directory for a fresh new build.  It will delete the CNAME file for your custom domain from GitHub so make sure you do a pull before a push.

### Date

+ Date format: ``` 2021-01-24T00:00:00-08:00 ```
+ [TOML date](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/toml.md#user-content-offset-date-time)
