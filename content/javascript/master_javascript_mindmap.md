![A master JavaScript mindmap](../../images/javascript/master_javascript_mindmap.png "Master JavaScript mindmap")

JavaScript, the language of the web!   It's a powerful language. I wanted to share some of what I learnt over the years whilst giving myself a refresher course.  To kick things off, I put a mindmap together. It's a work in progress, but it's a reference for me, and if I update the underlying mindmap, I'll update this page too. I'm hoping it will be of some use to others beginning on their JavaScript journey.

The red arrows in the diagram are links but Freemind doesn't export those when output to PDF.  Most of the links are from the [Mozilla developer website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
