Back when I left university,  I already knew I was heading for a career in technology. After building my first website back in 2000 and getting instant gratification and praise - I was hooked!

Fast forward two decades, and my passion to build things, is undiminished. Albeit, now I have moved on to bigger challenges such as website redesigns, platform migration, PCI, database architecture, process implementation, agile coaching and team management.

I do the work because I love technology. I like the people I meet and working with them to solve the challenges at hand.
