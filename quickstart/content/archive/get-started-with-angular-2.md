# Get started with Angular 2 in 5 minutes

This is quick guide to help you get started with [Angular 2](https://angular.io/).

# Assumptions

+ Node, npm and Visual Studio Code are all already installed.

# Get started

From Visual Studio Code start up the Integrated Terminal via View > Integrated Terminal.  

Then install Angular CLI with the following command:

```
npm i -g angular-cli
```

Now you have Angular CLI installed lets create a sample app.

```
ng new my-sample-app
```
The above command sets up a bare-bones Angular instance to help you get started with Angular 4 fast.  So let's fire it up and see what we get:

```
ng serve
```

In your browser navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

If all goes well Webpack will build your new app and should see 'app works!' in the browser.
